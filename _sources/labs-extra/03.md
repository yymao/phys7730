## A. Coin Flips

:::{dropdown} Hints for the implementation of Question 1
- From class you should obtain the expression for $\sigma_p$.
  You can then rewrite the inequality as $\hat{p} - 2 \sigma_p > 0.5 $,
  such that the left hand side only depends on $K$ and $N$.

  Here's a (not efficient, but easy to understand) way to find the minimal value of $K$
  for the inequality to hold.
    ```python
    import numpy as np

    N = 100
    for K in range(1, N+1):
        if ... > 0.5:  # TODO: replace ... with the expression of \hat{p} - 2 \sigma_p but in terms of K and N
            print(K)
            break
    ```

:::{dropdown} Hints for the implementation of Question 2
-   To simulate the number of heads for 100 coin flips, you can simply run
    ```python
    import numpy as np

    n_flips = 100  # number of coin flips
    p_heads = 0.5  # heads probability
    n_heads = np.random.default_rng().binomial(n_flips, p_heads)
    print(n_heads)
    ```
    Note that each time you run the code above, `n_heads` has a different value.

-   The above would be one "simulation". Repeat this simulation 10,000 time and collect the `n_heads` from each simulation.
-   You can then use [`np.percentile`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.percentile.html) to calculate
    the percentile corresponding to $2\sigma$ among the 10,000 `n_heads` values.

## B. Estimator Properties

:::{dropdown} Hints for "How to verify" 1
- Here's a snippet to get you started with the code structure:
    ```python
    import numpy as np

    a = ...  # TODO: set the true value of a
    b = ...  # TODO: set the true value of b
    N = ...  # TODO: set the number of x's

    x = np.random.default_rng().uniform(a, b, size=N)
    a_mle = np.min(x)  # this would be \hat{a}
    b_mle = np.max(x)  # this would be \hat{b}

    # TODO: repeat the above with different values of N and see how a_mle and b_mle change as N increases
    ```

:::{dropdown} Hints for "How to verify" 2
- Here's a snippet to get you started with the code structure:
    ```python
    a = ...  # TODO: set the true value of a
    b = ...  # TODO: set the true value of b
    N = ...  # TODO: set the number of x's
    K = ...  # TODO: set the number of simulations

    a_mle_avg = 0
    b_mle_avg = 0
    for _ in range(K):
        x = np.random.default_rng().uniform(a, b, size=N)
        a_mle_avg += np.min(x)
        b_mle_avg += np.max(x)
    a_mle_avg /= K  # this would be $E(\hat{a})$
    b_mle_avg /= K  # this would be $E(\hat{b})$

    # TODO: repeat the above with different values of K and see how a_mle_avg and b_mle_avg change as K increases
    ```
