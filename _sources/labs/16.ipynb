    "3. There are 816 parameters in the second layer, and 17 in the third layer. Explain where the numbers 816 and 17 come from. \n",
    "4. The model is trained with 40 epochs, and there are 30 steps in each epoch. Explain where the number 30 comes from.\n",
    "5. From the two plots near the end, we observe that the \"early stopping\" method should help prevent overfitting. What would be a good epoch to stop? \n",
    "6. The two plots show that, for the validation set, the loss keeps increasing as the epoch increases, but the accuracy roughly stays constant. \n",
