    "## A. Sample Average and Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup and Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate $n=500$ random variates from the exponential distribution with $\\lambda = 0.5$ (corresponding to `scale=2`; see Lab 2A). \n",
    "   Calculate the sample average and variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Repeat [Step 1]  $k=1,000$ times. You will get $k$ different values of the sample average. Plot a histogram of these $k$ sample averages. \n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of the sample averages will approach a normal distribution as $k$ increases. \n",
    "   Does your result agree with CLT? What is the variance of the these $k$ sample averages? \n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you change the value of $n$, will the variance of the the $k$ sample averages (from [Step 2]) change? Make a prediction, reason your prediction, and evaluate your prediction.\n",

    "3. If you change the value of $k$, will the variance of the the $k$ sample averages (from [Step 2]) change? Make a prediction, reason your prediction, and evaluate your prediction.\n"
