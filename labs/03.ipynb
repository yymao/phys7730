    "We flip a coin $N=100$ times and we want to know at least how many heads we need to see \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Estimate your answer using MLE.** The MLE for the heads probability is $\\hat{p} = K/N$. \n",
    "   The uncertainty of $\\hat{p}$ can be estimated with Fisher information:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "     \\sigma_p = \\left(\\left. - \\frac{d^2}{dp^2} \\left[\\ln L(p)\\right] \\right\\vert_{p=\\hat{p}} \\right)^{-1/2} \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   To say that the coin favors heads at a $2\\sigma$ level, we should have $\\hat{p} > 0.5 + 2 \\sigma_p$ \n",
    "   (that is, the heads probability is $2\\sigma$ above fair).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Express both $\\hat{p}$ and $\\sigma_p$ in terms of $K$ and $N$, then set $N=100$ and find the minimal value of $K$\n",
    "   for the inequality to hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Estimate your answer with a direct simulation.** \n",
    "\n",
    "   Simulate a fair coin flip for $N=100$ times, record the number of heads. \n",
    "   Repeat this simulation for 10,000 times, and then make a histogram of the number of heads (you should have 10,000 such values).\n",
    "\n",
    "   This histogram would look like a normal distribution, and\n",
    "   we can use the normal distribution to translate \"$2\\sigma$\" into percentiles, which would be 2.275% (lower) and 97.725% (higher).\n",
    "   Out of the 10,000 simulations, find the value number of heads at the percentile of 97.725%.\n",

    "\n",
    "Use MLE to estimate $a$ and $b$, we have $\\hat{a} = \\min_{i} x_i$ (the smallest value of $x_i$) and $\\hat{b} = \\max_{i} x_i$ (the largest value of $x_i$). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Are $\\hat{a}$ and $\\hat{b}$ consistent estimators (that is, as $N$ increases, does the estimator converge towards the true value)? \n",
    "   Reason your answer, and then verify it with simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For a given finite $N$, are $\\hat{a}$ and $\\hat{b}$ unbiased estimators (that is, are the expected value of the estimator and the true value equal)? \n",
    "   Reason your answer, and then verify it with simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to verify\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose two of your favorite numbers as the true values for $a$ and $b$ (with $a < b$). \n",
    "\n",
    "1. - Generate $N=10$ random numbers and calculate $\\hat{a}$ and $\\hat{b}$. \n",
    "   - Repeat many times but each time with a different value of $N$ (e.g., 10, 100, 1000, 10,000)\n",
    "   - Find out how $\\hat{a}$ and $\\hat{b}$ vary with $N$ and whether they approach $a$ and $b$ as $N$ increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. - Choose a value of $N$ (e.g., 100) and keep it fixed for this part.\n",
    "   - Generate $N$ random numbers and calculate $\\hat{a}$ and $\\hat{b}$. \n",
    "   - Repeat many times ($K$ times) with the fixed value of $N$.\n",
    "   - Calculate the sample average of $\\hat{a}$ and $\\hat{b}$. \n",
    "   - Recall that as you increase your simulation sample size (that is $K$, *not* $N$), the sample average would approach the expected value.\n",
    "   - Find out whether $\\hat{a}$ and $\\hat{b}$ approach $a$ and $b$ as $K$ increases."
