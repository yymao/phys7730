## B. Double the Rewards!

:::{dropdown} Hints for Part B: theoretical expected value

The *theoretical* expected value of your reward is $ (3/2)^{n_\text{flips}} $ dollars.

:::{dropdown} Hints for Part B3 - Code

```python
n_flips = 1000
n_games = 100
n_sims = 10

p_baised_values = np.linspace(0, 1, 101)[1:-1]
typical_log_average_reward = []
for p_biased in p_baised_values:

    # The following inner part is identical to B2
    log_average_reward_each_sim = []
    for _ in range(n_sims):

        log_reward_each_game = []
        log_weight_each_game = []
        for _ in range(n_games):
            game_result = run_one_game(n_flips, p_biased)
            n_heads = np.count_nonzero(game_result)
            log_reward = np.log(2) * n_heads
            log_reward_each_game.append(log_reward)

        log_average_reward = logsumexp(np.add(log_reward_each_game, log_weight_each_game), b=1/n_games)
        log_average_reward_each_sim.append(log_average_reward)

    typical_log_average_reward.append(np.median(log_average_reward_each_sim))
