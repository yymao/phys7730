# Hints for Lab 3: Classical Inference I: Maximum Likelihood Estimation

*For the class on Wednesday, January 24th*

## A. Standard Error of Statistics

:::{dropdown} Hints for Part A

In terms of coding, you have already done something very similar in [Lab 2](../labs/02), Part A.
Here's a code snippet on how to collect things if you don't recall.
You will need this structure for both A1 and A2.

```python
import numpy as np

number_of_runs = ...

mean_collected = []
median_collected = []
variance_collected = []

for _ in range(number_of_runs):
    mean = np.mean(...)
    median = np.median(...)
    variance = np.var(...)
    mean_collected.append(mean)
    median_collected.append(median)
    variance_collected.append(variance)

# TODO: then do things with mean_collected, median_collected, variance_collected
```

## B. Comparing samples

:::{dropdown} Hints for Question 1
Recall from Part A that you can estimate $\lambda$ and the standard error on your estimate!
