# PHYS/ASTR 7730 - Spring 2024

This website hosts the course materials and labs for PHYS/ASTR 7730,
**Statistical and Computational Methods in Physics and Astronomy**, taught by
[Yao-Yuan Mao](https://yymao.github.io/) at the University of Utah, in Spring 2024.

:::{warning}
You are looking at the course contents for Spring 2024.
The <a href="../">Spring 2025 course</a> will have similar but updated contents.
:::

This course will discuss a few widely applicable statistical and computational methods of analyzing and
modeling phenomena in astrophysics, biophysics, and physics in general. The learning objective is to apply
the methods learned in this course to connect experimental or observational data with underlying physical
processes through numerical simulations and statistical analyses.
Topics that will be covered in this course include stochastic process simulations, Monte Carlo methods,
Bayesian analysis, and basic machine learning algorithms. This is a graduate-level course. The course
will use Python as the programming language for demonstration and use many examples in physics and astronomy.
Students are assumed to be comfortable in programming and have an introductory-level knowledge in physics.
