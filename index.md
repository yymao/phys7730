## PHYS/ASTR 7730: Statistical and Computational Methods in Physics & Astronomy

### Spring 2024 Draft Syllabus

> üí° <span style="color: #5eb95e;">**The course description and prerequisites listed below are up-to-date and supersede the version on the U's course catalog.**</span>

#### Course Information
- Instructor: [Yao-Yuan Mao](https://yymao.github.io/), University of Utah.
- Days / Times: Mon & Wed / 3:00PM - 4:45PM
- Locations: [PHYS](https://map.utah.edu/?code=PHYS) 205

#### Course Description

This course will discuss a few widely applicable statistical and computational methods of analyzing and 
modeling phenomena in astrophysics, biophysics, and physics in general. The learning objective is to apply 
the methods learned in this course to connect experimental or observational data with underlying physical 
processes through numerical simulations and statistical analyses. 
Topics that will be covered in this course include stochastic process simulations, Monte Carlo methods, 
Bayesian analysis, and basic machine learning algorithms. This is a graduate-level course. The course 
will use Python as the programming language for demonstration and use many examples in physics and astronomy. 
Students are assumed to be comfortable in programming and have an introductory-level knowledge in physics.

#### Prerequisites

No required course prerequisites, but students are expected to be comfortable in coding (preferably in Python) 
to be able to complete assignments and projects independently.
