## Learning Objectives

This course is a graduate-level course focusing on a selection of widely applicable statistical and computational methods in physics and astronomy. The main learning objectives of this course are:

- Being able to identify statistical or computational methods that are potentially applicable for a research problem in physics and astronomy; 
- Being able to design or set up statistical tests, computational models, and/or simulations to tackle the said problem;
- Being able to interpret the results, assess the method's effectiveness, and revise the method as needed;
- Being able to examine and experiment with other statistical or computational methods that may not be covered in this class.

Please note that we will use Python as the programming language for demonstration and use many examples in physics and astronomy. Students are assumed to be comfortable in programming and have an introductory-level knowledge in physics.

## Course Materials and Schedule

There is no required textbook for this course.
Access to required reading, labs, and other course materials will be posted on the course website (this site).

## Course Components and Grading

This course has multiple components: lectures, in-class discussions, pre-lecture reading, homework, mock exam, and presentations --- each of these is designed to help you learn the materials better. You are expected to participate in/work on all of the course components. However, if there is anything that is preventing you from participating in the coursework or learning effectively, please talk to the instructor so that we can find creative solutions. 

If you would like to request accommodations (either with or without a letter from the [Center for Disability & Access](https://disability.utah.edu/)), please reach out to the instructor at your earliest convenience.

Your grade will be determined from all of the components, with the following weights:

| Component | Grading Weight |
|-----------|----------------|
| Pre-lecture reading | 20% |
| Homework (completing labs) | 20% |
| In-class participation & discussion | 40% |
| Midterm mock exam & presentation | 10% |
| Final presentation | 10% |

See the respective sections below for details of how each component is evaluated.

### Letter Grade Policy

The table below lists the "guaranteed" letter grade thresholds -- that is, if your final numerical score is higher than a listed threshold in the table, you are guaranteed to receive at least the corresponding letter grade. These thresholds may be lowered, but will not be raised. 

| Letter Grade | Maximal Thresholds |
|-----------|----------------|
| A  | 94% |
| A- | 90% |
| B+ | 86% |
| B  | 82% |
| B- | 78% |
| C+ | 72% |
| C  | 66% |
| C- | 60% |


## Pre-lecture Reading

Pre-lecture reading will be assigned via Canvas. You will need to complete the assigned reading before each lecture, and submit your answers to the accompanying questions on Canvas. These accompanying questions may:

- ask you to briefly summarize what you read;
- ask you if you have any questions about what you read;
- ask you simple questions that are related to what you read. 

Each pre-lecture reading assignment will be graded on a 5-point scale, with 4 points on completeness, and 1 point on quality. In other words, if you complete all the questions, you will receive at least 4 points, and can receive up to 5 points depending on the quality of your answers. You may receive less than 4 points if you do not complete all the questions.  

Late submission within a week (regardless of how late you were within the week) will receive a 25% deduction on the points you receive. Late submission beyond a week will receive no points.

Each pre-lecture reading assignment will be weighted equally. The lowest 2 pre-lecture reading assignment will be dropped.

Each pre-lecture reading assignment should take about 1-2 hours to complete. 

## Homework (Labs)

A lab component will be included in each class. These labs involve hands-on practices on the topics being covered. Students will have time in class to start working on those labs and to ask questions. However, given the limited class time, in most cases you may not have enough time to fully complete the labs. 

The homework assignments of this course will simply be completing those labs, and there won't be additional homework assignments. 

Each homework assignment (lab) will be due in exactly one week, at the class start time (so a lab from a Monday class will due at 3pm on the following Monday). The lab will be announced in class on the course website (this site). Once you complete the lab (which is the homework assignment), you should submit it on Canvas. 

Each homework assignment will be graded on a 5-point scale, with 4 points on completeness, and 1 point on quality. In other words, if you complete the entire lab, you will receive at least 4 points (even if you made mistakes), and you can receive up to 5 points depending on the quality of your answers. You may receive less than 4 points if you do not complete the entire lab. 

Late submission within a week (regardless of how late you were within the week) will receive a 25% deduction on the points you receive. Late submission beyond a week will receive no points.

Each homework assignment (lab) will be weighted equally. The lowest 2 homework assignments will be dropped.

Each homework assignment (lab) should take about 1-2 hours to complete. 

## In-class Participation and Discussion

Your participation in the discussion and lecture will constitute a significant part (40%) of your final grade. For each meeting, your participation will be graded on a 5-point scale with the following rubrics:

- 2 points for timely and full attendance (less than 2 points will be given for partial attendance)
- 2 points for fully engaging in the discussion / class activities (less than 2 points will be given for partial engagement)
- 1 point for the quality of engagement (see below for details)

Under this rubrics, if you show up in class (for the full period) and is fully engaged, you will get a minimum of 4 points, and up to 5 points, for each class.

Your score for each meeting will be weighted equally. The lowest 4 scores will be dropped. 

### Quality of Engagement

You will earn a higher score on the quality of engagement when you come prepared! For example, spending time thinking about the questions in the pre-lecture reading assignments can help you engage better. It's important to note that the quality of engagement is *not* graded based on how much you spoke in class or how correct you were. It is graded based on **how much you contribute to the learning experiences** of yourself, other students, and the instructor (yes, the instructor learns from you all too!). High quality engagement usually prompts further reflection, thinking, and discussion.

## Mock Exam and Presentation

The mock exam will a timed, closed-book exam. It is a "mock" exam because it will be graded on attempt only. After the mock exam, students will be split into groups, and each group will be assigned one question to solve (open book, open discussion). On the group presentation day, each group will present their solutions to the class.

After the presentation, each member of the group will submit a brief (<300 words) contribution statement that (1) summarizes their contribution in the group, and (2) comment on how their group mates participate. 

The mock exam and presentation will be graded with the following rubric, with a total of 10 points:

- 2 points for attempting the mock exam
- 2 points for showing up and giving a complete presentation on the assigned problem
- 2 points for clearly laying out how you approach the problem
- 1 point for solving the assigned problem(s) correctly
- 1 point for validating, interpreting, and discussing the solutions you reached
- 1 point for engaging in the Q&A
- 1 point based on the contribution statements

## Final Project Presentation

Each student will choose a specific problem, preferably a problem they encounter in their research work, and apply a statistical or computational method to tackle the chosen problem. The chosen method does not need to be a method that this course has specifically covered, but should be closely connected to the material covered in this course. 

Each student will do a 5-minute "pre-presentation" to describe the chosen problem and the method they plan to use. In the final presentation week, each student will do a 10-minute presentation on their results.

Your presentation will be evaluated as follows -- with a total of 10 points: 

- 1 point for giving a complete pre-presentation
- 2 points for clearly describing the chosen problem
- 1 point for giving a complete final presentation
- 2 points for clearly describing how you implement your chosen method to your chosen problem
- 1 point for summarizing the results you obtained
- 2 points for validating, interpreting, and discussing the results you obtained
- 1 point for engaging in the Q&A
